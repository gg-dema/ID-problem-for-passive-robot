    "The subject of this notebook is the analysis of the underactuated system made of a passive planar robot, with N = #DOF = 3, configurated as PPR and PRR.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task is define as a regulation task in the plane, but, due the passivity of the joint, the only possibility for drive the robot to the desired pose is to use a cartesiaan force applied at a specific point, such the end-effector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such a system exibith a coupling behaviour between the input variable and the state of the system.\n",
    "Using a change of coordinate developed by the professor A.D.L. and his phd student Piero XXXXX, i have shown that such a system can be decoupled by a invertible change of coordinate. \n",
    "After the development of the theretical background for the change of coordinate, I have applied a simple pd controller (without gravitation cancellation/compensation) and show the result of this decopling system. \n",
